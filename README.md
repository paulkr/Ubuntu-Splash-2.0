Ubuntu Splash 2.0
=================

A Microsoft Paint clone written in python using the pygame graphics library for the ICS3U Paint Project.

For this project, we needed to select an overall theme and as you can tell from it's title,
I decided my theme to be the Ubuntu Desktop.

Features
--------

Ubuntu Splash has most features that you would find on a regular paint program
